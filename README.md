The SIMBA DSS decision support system consists of 2 applications: SIMBA SOLVER and SIMBA PLANNER.

SIMBA SOLVER application is a working environment for modeling the process of finding the optimal solution (search for the optimal alternative). The program includes two independent decision-making methods: the AWSM method and the Franklin method. Thus, you can work with any method independently, using another method if necessary (second opinion).

The SIMBA PLANNER application is a SIMBA SOLVER project planner and allows you to:
1. Combine already created SIMBA SOLVER projects into a plan
2. Plan projects (prioritization by importance / urgency / type)
3. Monitor the main parameters of the projects
4. Quickly open (double click on the project line) projects for working in the SIMBA SOLVER program
